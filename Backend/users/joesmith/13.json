    "2024-09-14 20:59:11 760": "I'm sorry to hear that you're feeling unwell. The flu, or influenza, is a viral infection that can cause a variety of symptoms. Common symptoms include:\n\n- Fever or feeling feverish/chills\n- Cough\n- Sore throat\n- Runny or stuffy nose\n- Muscle or body aches\n- Headaches\n- Fatigue (tiredness)\n- Some people may experience vomiting and diarrhea, though this is more common in children than adults.\n\nTo better assess your condition, I need to ask you a few more questions:\n\n1. How long have you been experiencing these symptoms?\n2. Are you experiencing any difficulty breathing or chest pain?\n3. Have you been in contact with anyone who has the flu?\n4. Do you have any underlying health conditions such as asthma, diabetes, or heart disease?\n\nIn the meantime, here are some general recommendations to manage flu symptoms:\n\n- Get plenty of rest.\n- Stay hydrated by drinking water, herbal teas, or broth.\n- Use over-the-counter medications like acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Advil) to help reduce fever and alleviate aches and pains.\n- Stay isolated as much as possible to prevent spreading the virus to others.\n\nIf your symptoms are severe, if you have difficulty breathing, chest pain, sudden dizziness, confusion, or severe vomiting, please seek medical attention immediately.\n\nFeel free to share more details about your symptoms so I can provide better guidance."
